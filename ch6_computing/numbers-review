Numbers Review
## Integers

In Python, numbers without a decimal part are called Integers.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, 3 and -3 are both examples of integers.
Floats

A float is, as you may have guessed, the number type that allows for decimal values.

my_int = 5
my_float = 5.5

____ and ____ are numerical types in Python.

## Floor division

Python has great out-of-the-box support for mathematical operations. This, among other reasons, is why it has had such success in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science applications.

Floor division is like normal division except the result is floored afterward, which means the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. The // operator is used for floor division.

7 // 3
 2 (an integer, rounded down from 2.333)
-7 // 3
 -3 (an integer, rounded down from -2.333)

What would be the result of 11 // 2 ?
- 5 (an integer, rounded down from 5.5)


## Exponents

Python has built-in support for exponents - something most languages require a math library for.

 reads as "three squared" or
 "three raised to the second power"
3 ** 2
 9

What is 2 ** 3?
 reads as "two cubed"
 "two raised to the third power"
- 8

Anything raised to the 0th power is always 1
 1**0 = 1 
 2**0 = 1 
 5**0 = 1
