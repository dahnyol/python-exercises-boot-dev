Range Continued

The range() function we've been using in our for loops actually has an optional 3rd parameter: the "step".

for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
# prints:
# 0
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8

The "step" parameter determines how much to add to i in each iteration of the loop. You can even go backwards:

for i in range(3, 0, -1):
    print(i)
# prints:
# 3
# 2
# 1

Assignment

Fix the for loop in the count_down function so that it prints the numbers counting down from start to (but not including) end in order.
Tip

In the programming world, it's common for the first number in a range to be inclusive and the second number is exclusive. e.g. range(0, 10) will include:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
