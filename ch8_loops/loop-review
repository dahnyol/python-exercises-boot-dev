# Loop Review

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)

Prints the numbers 0-9 to the console.

Why would you want to use a loop?
- To do the same thing over and over without writing the same code.

Why does the code on the left print 0-999 and not 0-1000?
- Because print(i) only happens while i is less than (not equal to) 1000.

Whitespace matters in Python.
