Loops Practice

As a reminder, a "for loop" in Python is written like this:

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)

In English, the code says:

    Start with i equals 0. (i in range(0)
    If i is greater than or equal to 10 (range(0, 10)), exit the loop.
    Print i to the console. (print(i))
    Add 1 to i. (range defaults to incrementing by 1)
    Go back to step 2

The result is that the numbers 0-9 are logged to the console in order.
Whitespace matters in Python!

The body of a for-loop must be indented; otherwise, you'll get a syntax error.
Assignment

In the print_numbers function, write a for-loop from scratch that logs the numbers 0-199 to the console.

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(0, 200):
        print(i)

def test():
    print("Printing numbers from 0 to 199:")
    print_numbers()
    print("=====================================")

    test()


main()
