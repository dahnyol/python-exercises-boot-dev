# Lists Continued

Sometimes when we're manually creating lists it can be hard to read if all the items are on the same line of code. We can declare the list using multiple lines if we want to:

flower_types = [
    "daffodil",
    "rose",
    "chrysanthemum"
]

player_ages = [
    23,
    18,
    31,
    42
]

Keep in mind this is just a styling change. The code will run correctly either way.

- When there are many items and it's hard to read them all on one line.

- All of them, Strings, Numbers and Booleans.
