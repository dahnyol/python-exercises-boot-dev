# Ordered or Unordered?

As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries were unordered.

Because dictionaries are ordered, the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items do not have a defined order, so you couldn't refer to an item by using an index.

# The takeaway is that if you're on Python 3.7 or later, you'll be able to iterate over dictionaries in the same order every time.


Python dictionaries before 3.7 were _
- unordered
