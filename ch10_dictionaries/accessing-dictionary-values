# Accessing Dictionary Values

Dictionary elements must be accessible somehow in code, otherwise they wouldn't be very useful.

A value is retrieved from a dictionary by specifying its corresponding key in square brackets. The square brackets look similar to indexing into a list.

car = {
    "make": "tesla",
    "model": "3"
}
print(car["make"])
# Prints: tesla


Which kind of brackets are used to index into a dictionary?
- square
